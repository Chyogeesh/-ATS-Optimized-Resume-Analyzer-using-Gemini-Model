# -ATS-Optimized-Resume-Analyzer-using-Gemini-Model
It is a Salesforce project
To create the backend services for the CareerCraft ATS-Optimized Resume Analyzer, we will focus on the main functionalities: parsing resumes and job descriptions, analyzing the content, and providing keyword suggestions. Below is a structured approach with code snippets to help you get started.
1. Resume and Job Description Parser
We'll use Python libraries like PyPDF2 for PDF parsing and docx for Word documents. Additionally, nltk can help with natural language processing tasks.
2. Keyword Extraction and Analysis
Next, we will implement a simple keyword extraction mechanism that identifies important keywords from both the resume and job description.
3. Providing Recommendations
Finally, we can create a function that suggests improvements based on the missing keywords.
File Parsing: We implemented functions to parse PDF and DOCX files to extract text.
Keyword Extraction: Using NLTK, we extracted keywords from the text.
Analysis and Recommendations: We compared the keywords from the resume and job description to identify missing keywords and generate recommendations.
